  - name: Anurag Gupta
    role: Ph.D Scholar (PMRF)
    bio: >
      Anurag is an M.Tech + Ph.D. dual degree student. He joined this lab because he is interested in the field of behavioral neuroscience. His research involves investigating intermanual (i.e., between the hands) transfer for a movement task involving the hands. Intermanual transfer is a phenomena where learning a particular task with one hand leads to performance gains of the same task in the other untrained hand. More specifically, he is investigating if manipulated visual feedback given through a VR headset can enhance this intermanual transfer. Additionally, he is also involved in building an IMU based hand kinematics measurement system. In his spare time, he likes meditating, swimming, going for long walks and watching movies.
