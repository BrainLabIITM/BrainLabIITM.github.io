                        I always feel that Neuromechanics Lab at IIT Madras is my second home. Our lab has more than sufficient facilities and state-of-art equipment for doing research in motor control domain. This lab is one of the foundation labs in India for doing research in human motor control domain. Lab members are extremely supportive and helpful. This lab focuses on various aspects of human hand function and draws possible conclusions about human behaviour based on hypothesis testing and experimental validations. Lab members are equipped with highly interdisciplinary background which not only helps them in doing research but later on in professional world. Dr. Varadhan (PI of NML) has a goal of making their students independent thinkers. He believes in guiding a student for making them successful person in life rather than spoon feeding them. From my personal experience I can definitely say that being part of this Neuromechanics Lab at IIT Madras, I can learn anything. All good things take time, but if we are persistent that time will definitely come.

                        I was a Dual Degree student and was very fortunate to pursue my final year project in Neuromechanics Lab. Although I was from Aerospace Engineering, Prof Varadhan SKM helped me in a smooth transition towards Neuromechanics by organizing seminars and discussions in the lab. The main take away has been the ability to learn and grasp concepts independently. The learning procedure in this lab is through discussion and not a one way thing. This provides you an opportunity to think and question even the opinions the Prof. Lab trains students to become independent researchers and be confident about themselves. I completely enjoyed and cherish my one year memorable journey in this lab.

                        My PhD journey at the Neuromechanics Lab, IIT Madras, was truly transformative. When I
                        joined, I expressed interest in pursuing an exchange opportunity or a joint PhD program. Prof.
                        Varadhan not only listened but actively worked to find the right collaboration. This led to my
                        PhD being converted into an IITM-NTU Joint PhD, allowing me to work in both Singapore
                        and India—an experience that shaped me academically and personally.
                        Both Prof. Varadhan and Prof. Domenico were exceptional mentors—supportive, encouraging,
                        and always expecting the best from me. Their high expectations pushed me to improve, helping
                        me grow as both a researcher and an independent thinker. Rather than handing me solutions,
                        they guided me toward problem-solving, fostering the mindset a PhD is meant to develop.
                        Prof. Varadhan has always been approachable and willing to help whenever I encountered
                        challenges, despite his busy schedule. His constructive feedback and personalized mentorship
                        approach ensured students received the guidance best suited to them. He also fostered a
                        collaborative lab environment where students openly discussed and supported each other's
                        research.
                        My PhD was more than just research—it was a journey of growth. I'm deeply grateful for the
                        mentorship and opportunities I received and highly recommend this lab to any aspiring
                        researcher.

                        As an experimentalist lab, we worked extensively with a diverse population, from young individuals to older adults, and sometimes even patients. 
                        This required rigorous training in proper experimental protocols, ethical considerations, and handling state-of-the-art equipment. 
                        Throughout my PhD, I significantly improved my skills in manuscript writing, scientific communication, and data presentation. 
                        Our professor not only guided us but also coached us in presenting our results in a well-structured manner, ensuring our manuscripts met high-quality standards.
