  - title: Electromagnetic tracking sensors (Polhemus Inc, USA)
    image: /static/img/facilities/polhemus_n.jpg
    description: >
      The liberty Electromagnetic tracking sensors from Polhemus are used to measure position and orientation in space. We are using 16 such sensors to mount on finger phanax and measure kinematics of human hand. 1.8mm diameter micro sensor provides full 6DOF tracking with 1.27 micron position resoultion and upto 0.0004 degree orientation resolution. We thank the cognitive science research initiative of Department of Science and technology for their generous support in getting this equipment.

  - title: Six-component Force/Torque sensors (ATI Industrial Automation, USA)
    image: /static/img/facilities/nano_n.jpg
    description: >
      The Nano 17 and Nano 25 sensors from ATI are used in measuring finger tip forces in all three directions. We have a set of 5 of these sensors that can be fit into objects of various sizes/shapes and many tasks can be studied. We thank IIT Madras for funding this equipment through the new faculty seed grant.

  - title: Linear Actuator (Actuonix, Canada)
    image: /static/img/facilities/actuator_n.png
    description: >
      The PQ12 series are one of the the smallest linear actuator. It weighs only 15g and features a stroke length of 20mm. The PQ12-P micro feedback actuators feature an internal potentiometer that can be used to provide position feedback. They do not have an internal controller or end-limit switches. You can use your PQ12 -P as a Linear Servo using the LAC (Linear Actuator Control) board. This combination has all the same functionality as the L12-I plus USB support, speed control, sensitivity control, position control, and adjustable end limits.

  - title: Virtual Reality Headset (HTC Vive)
    image: /static/img/facilities/htc_vive_n.jpg
    description: >
      Virtual reality headsets are head-mounted device that provides virtual environment for the wearer. VR headsets are widely used with computer games but they are also used in other applications, including simulators and trainers. The HTC Vive is a virtual reality headset developed by HTC and Valve Corporation. The headset uses "room scale" tracking technology, allowing the user to move in 3D space and use motion-tracked handheld controllers to interact with the environment.

  - title: Data Glove (Virtual Motion Labs, US)
    image: /static/img/facilities/vmg35_n.jpg
    description: >
      "Dataglove" is an input device for human–computer interaction worn like a glove. Various sensor technologies are used to capture physical data such as bending of fingers. Often a motion tracker, such as a magnetic tracking device or inertial tracking device, is attached to capture the global position/rotation data of the glove. These movements are then interpreted by separate softwares. The VMG 35 Plus™ is a complete haptic glove, this includes 30 bend sensors and 5 vibro-tactile sensors.

  - title: PLATO Visual Occlusion Spectacles (Translucent Technologies, Canada)
    image: /static/img/facilities/glass_n.jpg
    description: >
      The PLATO lenses are constructed with specially designed liquid crystal cells, which are able to change rapidly from transparent (‘shutter open’) to light scattering (‘shutter closed’). In the Open state, looking through the lenses is like looking through clear glass. In the Closed (occluding) state, the spectacle lenses scatter light and thus take on a translucent milky texture, which prevents the subject from perceiving visual information on the other side. The subject’s eye nevertheless remains illuminated and does not have to re-adapt to light when re-opened.

  - title: Single-axis load cells (PCB Piezotronics, USA)
    image: /static/img/facilities/PIEZO_n.jpg
    description: >
      These sensors are used for measuring compressive normal forces (max 440 N). These can be used in studies that involve isometric force production (pressing).

    description: >
      To measure the friction coefficient between finger tip and material we have developed friction measurement system which consists of a Teensy microcontroller, ATI Nano25 and Labview to measure coefficient values.

  - title: Linear DC-Servomotor (Faulhaber, Switzerland)
    image: /static/img/facilities/MOTOR_n.jpg
    description: >
      These linear DC servo motors from Faulhaber MiniMotor, Switzerland are used to build an object whose shape changes while it is being grasped. Each motor is controlled independently, resulting in various shapes. We plan to use this setup to study changes in fingertip force coordination as a result of object shape change.
